# GitHubTest
This is used for me to learn GitHub commands and how to use it efficent

Goal: I'm an IT-expert that has only used GIT in TFS/VSTS via Visual Studio. Now I want to learn a bit more about GitHub - and how to use it without UX/GUI interface!

Lokalt: Dette gjøres i klonet branch på min maskin!
